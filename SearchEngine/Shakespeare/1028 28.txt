SCENE III. The same. Before the palace.


Enter two Soldiers to their guard


First Soldier

Brother, good night: to-morrow is the day.


Second Soldier

It will determine one way: fare you well.
Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?


First Soldier

Nothing. What news?


Second Soldier

Belike 'tis but a rumour. Good night to you.


First Soldier

Well, sir, good night.
Enter two other Soldiers


Second Soldier

Soldiers, have careful watch.


Third Soldier

And you. Good night, good night.
They place themselves in every corner of the stage


Fourth Soldier

Here we: and if to-morrow
Our navy thrive, I have an absolute hope
Our landmen will stand up.


Third Soldier

'Tis a brave army,
And full of purpose.
Music of the hautboys as under the stage


Fourth Soldier

Peace! what noise?


First Soldier

List, list!


Second Soldier

Hark!


First Soldier

    Music i' the air.


Third Soldier

Under the earth.


Fourth Soldier

It signs well, does it not?


Third Soldier

No.


First Soldier

Peace, I say!
What should this mean?


Second Soldier

'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony loved,
Now leaves him.


First Soldier

Walk; let's see if other watchmen
Do hear what we do?
They advance to another post


Second Soldier

How now, masters!


All

[Speaking together]  How now!
How now! do you hear this?


First Soldier

Ay; is't not strange?


Third Soldier

Do you hear, masters? do you hear?


First Soldier

Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;
Let's see how it will give off.


All

Content. 'Tis strange.
Exeunt
