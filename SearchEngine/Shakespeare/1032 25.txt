SCENE II. A field between the two camps.


Alarum within. Enter, with drum and colours,  KING LEAR, CORDELIA, and Soldiers, over the stage; and exeunt


Enter EDGAR and GLOUCESTER


EDGAR

Here, father, take the shadow of this tree
For your good host; pray that the right may thrive:
If ever I return to you again,
I'll bring you comfort.


GLOUCESTER

Grace go with you, sir!
Exit EDGAR
Alarum and retreat within. Re-enter EDGAR


EDGAR

Away, old man; give me thy hand; away!
King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en:
Give me thy hand; come on.


GLOUCESTER

No farther, sir; a man may rot even here.


EDGAR

What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure
Their going hence, even as their coming hither;
Ripeness is all: come on.


GLOUCESTER

And that's true too.
Exeunt
