SCENE IV. The same. A hall in Timon's house.


Enter two Servants of Varro, and the Servant of  LUCIUS, meeting TITUS, HORTENSIUS, and other Servants of TIMON's creditors, waiting his coming out


Varro's


First Servant

Well met; good morrow, Titus and Hortensius.


TITUS

The like to you kind Varro.


HORTENSIUS

Lucius!
What, do we meet together?
Lucilius' Servant	Ay, and I think
One business does command us all; for mine Is money.


TITUS

So is theirs and ours.
Enter PHILOTUS
Lucilius' Servant	And Sir Philotus too!


PHILOTUS

Good day at once.
Lucilius' Servant	                  Welcome, good brother.
What do you think the hour?


PHILOTUS

Labouring for nine.
Lucilius' Servant	So much?


PHILOTUS

Is not my lord seen yet?
Lucilius' Servant	Not yet.


PHILOTUS

I wonder on't; he was wont to shine at seven.
Lucilius' Servant	Ay, but the days are wax'd shorter with him:
You must consider that a prodigal course
Is like the sun's; but not, like his, recoverable.
I fear 'tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse;
That is one may reach deep enough, and yet
Find little.


PHILOTUS

I am of your fear for that.


TITUS

I'll show you how to observe a strange event.
Your lord sends now for money.


HORTENSIUS

Most true, he does.


TITUS

And he wears jewels now of Timon's gift,
For which I wait for money.


HORTENSIUS

It is against my heart.
Lucilius' Servant	Mark, how strange it shows,
Timon in this should pay more than he owes:
And e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels,
And send for money for 'em.


HORTENSIUS

I'm weary of this charge, the gods can witness:
I know my lord hath spent of Timon's wealth,
And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth.
Varro's


First Servant

Yes, mine's three thousand crowns: what's yours?
Lucilius' Servant	Five thousand mine.
Varro's


First Servant

'Tis much deep: and it should seem by the sun,
Your master's confidence was above mine;
Else, surely, his had equall'd.
Enter FLAMINIUS.


TITUS

One of Lord Timon's men.
Lucilius' Servant	Flaminius! Sir, a word: pray, is my lord ready to
come forth?


FLAMINIUS

No, indeed, he is not.


TITUS

We attend his lordship; pray, signify so much.


FLAMINIUS

I need not tell him that; he knows you are too diligent.
Exit
Enter FLAVIUS in a cloak, muffled
Lucilius' Servant	Ha! is not that his steward muffled so?
He goes away in a cloud: call him, call him.


TITUS

Do you hear, sir?
Varro's


Second Servant

By your leave, sir,--


FLAVIUS

What do ye ask of me, my friend?


TITUS

We wait for certain money here, sir.


FLAVIUS

Ay,
If money were as certain as your waiting,
'Twere sure enough.
Why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills,
When your false masters eat of my lord's meat?
Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts
And take down the interest into their
gluttonous maws.
You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up;
Let me pass quietly:
Believe 't, my lord and I have made an end;
I have no more to reckon, he to spend.
Lucilius' Servant	Ay, but this answer will not serve.


FLAVIUS

If 'twill not serve,'tis not so base as you;
For you serve knaves.
Exit
Varro's


First Servant

How! what does his cashiered worship mutter?
Varro's


Second Servant

No matter what; he's poor, and that's revenge
enough. Who can speak broader than he that has no
house to put his head in? such may rail against
great buildings.
Enter SERVILIUS


TITUS

O, here's Servilius; now we shall know some answer.


SERVILIUS

If I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair some
other hour, I should derive much from't; for,
take't of my soul, my lord leans wondrously to
discontent: his comfortable temper has forsook him;
he's much out of health, and keeps his chamber.
Lucilius' Servant: Many do keep their chambers are not sick:
And, if it be so far beyond his health,
Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts,
And make a clear way to the gods.


SERVILIUS

Good gods!


TITUS

We cannot take this for answer, sir.


FLAMINIUS

[Within]  Servilius, help! My lord! my lord!
Enter TIMON, in a rage, FLAMINIUS following


TIMON

What, are my doors opposed against my passage?
Have I been ever free, and must my house
Be my retentive enemy, my gaol?
The place which I have feasted, does it now,
Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?
Lucilius' Servant	Put in now, Titus.


TITUS

My lord, here is my bill.
Lucilius' Servant	Here's mine.


HORTENSIUS

And mine, my lord.
Both
Varro's Servants	And ours, my lord.


PHILOTUS

All our bills.


TIMON

Knock me down with 'em: cleave me to the girdle.
Lucilius' Servant	Alas, my lord,-


TIMON

Cut my heart in sums.


TITUS

Mine, fifty talents.


TIMON

Tell out my blood.
Lucilius' Servant	Five thousand crowns, my lord.


TIMON

Five thousand drops pays that.
What yours?--and yours?
Varro's


First Servant

My lord,--
Varro's


Second Servant

My lord,--


TIMON

Tear me, take me, and the gods fall upon you!
Exit


HORTENSIUS

'Faith, I perceive our masters may throw their caps
at their money: these debts may well be called
desperate ones, for a madman owes 'em.
Exeunt
Re-enter TIMON and FLAVIUS


TIMON

They have e'en put my breath from me, the slaves.
Creditors? devils!


FLAVIUS

My dear lord,--


TIMON

What if it should be so?


FLAVIUS

My lord,--


TIMON

I'll have it so. My steward!


FLAVIUS

Here, my lord.


TIMON

So fitly? Go, bid all my friends again,
Lucius, Lucullus, and Sempronius:
All, sirrah, all:
I'll once more feast the rascals.


FLAVIUS

O my lord,
You only speak from your distracted soul;
There is not so much left, to furnish out
A moderate table.


TIMON

                  Be't not in thy care; go,
I charge thee, invite them all: let in the tide
Of knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide.
Exeunt
