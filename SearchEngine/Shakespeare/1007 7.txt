He is the wiser man, master doctor: he is a curer of

Is it not true, Master Page?


PAGE

Master Shallow, you have yourself been a great
fighter, though now a man of peace.


SHALLOW

Bodykins, Master Page, though I now be old and of
the peace, if I see a sword out, my finger itches to
make one. Though we are justices and doctors and
churchmen, Master Page, we have some salt of our
youth in us; we are the sons of women, Master Page.


PAGE

'Tis true, Master Shallow.


SHALLOW

It will be found so, Master Page. Master Doctor
Caius, I am come to fetch you home. I am sworn of
the peace: you have showed yourself a wise
physician, and Sir Hugh hath shown himself a wise
and patient churchman. You must go with me, master doctor.
