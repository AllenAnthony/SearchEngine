SCENE III. A room in the Garter Inn.


Enter Host and BARDOLPH


BARDOLPH

Sir, the Germans desire to have three of your
horses: the duke himself will be to-morrow at
court, and they are going to meet him.


Host

What duke should that be comes so secretly? I hear
not of him in the court. Let me speak with the
gentlemen: they speak English?


BARDOLPH

Ay, sir; I'll call them to you.


Host

They shall have my horses; but I'll make them pay;
I'll sauce them: they have had my house a week at
command; I have turned away my other guests: they
must come off; I'll sauce them. Come.
Exeunt
