SCENE VII. The gates of Corioli.


TITUS LARTIUS, having set a guard upon  Corioli, going with drum and trumpet toward  COMINIUS and CAIUS MARCIUS, enters with Lieutenant, other Soldiers, and a Scout


LARTIUS

So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,
As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch
Those centuries to our aid: the rest will serve
For a short holding: if we lose the field,
We cannot keep the town.


Lieutenant

Fear not our care, sir.


LARTIUS

Hence, and shut your gates upon's.
Our guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us.
Exeunt
