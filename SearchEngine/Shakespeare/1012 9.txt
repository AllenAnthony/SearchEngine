SCENE II. Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.


Enter TRANIO and HORTENSIO


TRANIO

Is't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?
I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.


HORTENSIO

Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,
Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.
Enter BIANCA and LUCENTIO


LUCENTIO

Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?


BIANCA

What, master, read you? first resolve me that.


LUCENTIO

I read that I profess, the Art to Love.


BIANCA

And may you prove, sir, master of your art!


LUCENTIO

While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart!


HORTENSIO

Quick proceeders, marry! Now, tell me, I pray,
You that durst swear at your mistress Bianca
Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio.


TRANIO

O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.


HORTENSIO

Mistake no more: I am not Licio,
Nor a musician, as I seem to be;
But one that scorn to live in this disguise,
For such a one as leaves a gentleman,
And makes a god of such a cullion:
Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio.


TRANIO

Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
Of your entire affection to Bianca;
And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
I will with you, if you be so contented,
Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.


HORTENSIO

See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
Never to woo her no more, but do forswear her,
As one unworthy all the former favours
That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.


TRANIO

And here I take the unfeigned oath,
Never to marry with her though she would entreat:
Fie on her! see, how beastly she doth court him!


HORTENSIO

Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
I will be married to a wealthy widow,
Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me
As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.
And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.
Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,
Shall win my love: and so I take my leave,
In resolution as I swore before.
Exit


TRANIO

Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,
And have forsworn you with Hortensio.


BIANCA

Tranio, you jest: but have you both forsworn me?


TRANIO

Mistress, we have.


LUCENTIO

                  Then we are rid of Licio.


TRANIO

I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,
That shall be wood and wedded in a day.


BIANCA

God give him joy!


TRANIO

Ay, and he'll tame her.


BIANCA

He says so, Tranio.


TRANIO

Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.


BIANCA

The taming-school! what, is there such a place?


TRANIO

Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master;
That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.
Enter BIONDELLO


BIONDELLO

O master, master, I have watch'd so long
That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied
An ancient angel coming down the hill,
Will serve the turn.


TRANIO

What is he, Biondello?


BIONDELLO

Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,
I know not what; but format in apparel,
In gait and countenance surely like a father.


LUCENTIO

And what of him, Tranio?


TRANIO

If he be credulous and trust my tale,
I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,
And give assurance to Baptista Minola,
As if he were the right Vincentio
Take in your love, and then let me alone.
Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA
Enter a Pedant


Pedant

God save you, sir!


TRANIO

                  And you, sir! you are welcome.
Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?


Pedant

Sir, at the farthest for a week or two:
But then up farther, and as for as Rome;
And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.


TRANIO

What countryman, I pray?


Pedant

Of Mantua.


TRANIO

Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid!
And come to Padua, careless of your life?


Pedant

My life, sir! how, I pray? for that goes hard.


TRANIO

'Tis death for any one in Mantua
To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
Your ships are stay'd at Venice, and the duke,
For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,
Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly:
'Tis, marvel, but that you are but newly come,
You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.


Pedant

Alas! sir, it is worse for me than so;
For I have bills for money by exchange
From Florence and must here deliver them.


TRANIO

Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
This will I do, and this I will advise you:
First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?


Pedant

Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
Pisa renowned for grave citizens.


TRANIO

Among them know you one Vincentio?


Pedant

I know him not, but I have heard of him;
A merchant of incomparable wealth.


TRANIO

He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.


BIONDELLO

[Aside]  As much as an apple doth an oyster,
and all one.


TRANIO

To save your life in this extremity,
This favour will I do you for his sake;
And think it not the worst of an your fortunes
That you are like to Sir Vincentio.
His name and credit shall you undertake,
And in my house you shall be friendly lodged:
Look that you take upon you as you should;
You understand me, sir: so shall you stay
Till you have done your business in the city:
If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.


Pedant

O sir, I do; and will repute you ever
The patron of my life and liberty.


TRANIO

Then go with me to make the matter good.
This, by the way, I let you understand;
my father is here look'd for every day,
To pass assurance of a dower in marriage
'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here:
In all these circumstances I'll instruct you:
Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.
Exeunt
