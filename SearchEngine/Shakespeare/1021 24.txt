SCENE II. France. Plains in Anjou.


Enter CHARLES, BURGUNDY, ALENCON, BASTARD OF ORLEANS, REIGNIER, JOAN LA PUCELLE, and forces


CHARLES

These news, my lord, may cheer our drooping spirits:
'Tis said the stout Parisians do revolt
And turn again unto the warlike French.


ALENCON

Then march to Paris, royal Charles of France,
And keep not back your powers in dalliance.


JOAN LA PUCELLE

Peace be amongst them, if they turn to us;
Else, ruin combat with their palaces!
Enter Scout


Scout

Success unto our valiant general,
And happiness to his accomplices!


CHARLES

What tidings send our scouts? I prithee, speak.


Scout

The English army, that divided was
Into two parties, is now conjoined in one,
And means to give you battle presently.


CHARLES

Somewhat too sudden, sirs, the warning is;
But we will presently provide for them.


BURGUNDY

I trust the ghost of Talbot is not there:
Now he is gone, my lord, you need not fear.


JOAN LA PUCELLE

Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.
Command the conquest, Charles, it shall be thine,
Let Henry fret and all the world repine.


CHARLES

Then on, my lords; and France be fortunate!
Exeunt
