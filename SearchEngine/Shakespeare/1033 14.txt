SCENE III. A park near the palace.


Enter three Murderers


First Murderer

But who did bid thee join with us?


Third Murderer

Macbeth.


Second Murderer

He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers
Our offices and what we have to do
To the direction just.


First Murderer

Then stand with us.
The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day:
Now spurs the lated traveller apace
To gain the timely inn; and near approaches
The subject of our watch.


Third Murderer

Hark! I hear horses.


BANQUO

[Within]  Give us a light there, ho!


Second Murderer

Then 'tis he: the rest
That are within the note of expectation
Already are i' the court.


First Murderer

His horses go about.


Third Murderer

Almost a mile: but he does usually,
So all men do, from hence to the palace gate
Make it their walk.


Second Murderer

A light, a light!
Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE with a torch


Third Murderer

'Tis he.


First Murderer

Stand to't.


BANQUO

It will be rain to-night.


First Murderer

Let it come down.
They set upon BANQUO


BANQUO

O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
Thou mayst revenge. O slave!
Dies. FLEANCE escapes


Third Murderer

Who did strike out the light?


First Murderer

Wast not the way?


Third Murderer

There's but one down; the son is fled.


Second Murderer

We have lost
Best half of our affair.


First Murderer

Well, let's away, and say how much is done.
Exeunt
