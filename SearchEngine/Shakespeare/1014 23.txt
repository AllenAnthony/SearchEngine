SCENE IX. Another part of the plains.


Enter AGAMEMNON, AJAX, MENELAUS, NESTOR, DIOMEDES, and others, marching. Shouts within


AGAMEMNON

Hark! hark! what shout is that?


NESTOR

Peace, drums!
Within
Achilles! Achilles! Hector's slain! Achilles.


DIOMEDES

The bruit is, Hector's slain, and by Achilles.


AJAX

If it be so, yet bragless let it be;
Great Hector was a man as good as he.


AGAMEMNON

March patiently along: let one be sent
To pray Achilles see us at our tent.
If in his death the gods have us befriended,
Great Troy is ours, and our sharp wars are ended.
Exeunt, marching
