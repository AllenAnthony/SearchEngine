SCENE III. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.


Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS


CLEOPATRA

Where is the fellow?


ALEXAS

Half afeard to come.


CLEOPATRA

Go to, go to.
Enter the Messenger as before
Come hither, sir.


ALEXAS

Good majesty,
Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
But when you are well pleased.


CLEOPATRA

That Herod's head
I'll have: but how, when Antony is gone
Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.


Messenger

Most gracious majesty,--


CLEOPATRA

Didst thou behold Octavia?


Messenger

Ay, dread queen.


CLEOPATRA

Where?


Messenger

Madam, in Rome;
I look'd her in the face, and saw her led
Between her brother and Mark Antony.


CLEOPATRA

Is she as tall as me?


Messenger

She is not, madam.


CLEOPATRA

Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongued or low?


Messenger

Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voiced.


CLEOPATRA

That's not so good: he cannot like her long.


CHARMIAN

Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.


CLEOPATRA

I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish!
What majesty is in her gait? Remember,
If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.


Messenger

She creeps:
Her motion and her station are as one;
She shows a body rather than a life,
A statue than a breather.


CLEOPATRA

Is this certain?


Messenger

Or I have no observance.


CHARMIAN

Three in Egypt
Cannot make better note.


CLEOPATRA

He's very knowing;
I do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet:
The fellow has good judgment.


CHARMIAN

Excellent.


CLEOPATRA

Guess at her years, I prithee.


Messenger

Madam,
She was a widow,--


CLEOPATRA

                  Widow! Charmian, hark.


Messenger

And I do think she's thirty.


CLEOPATRA

Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round?


Messenger

Round even to faultiness.


CLEOPATRA

For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.
Her hair, what colour?


Messenger

Brown, madam: and her forehead
As low as she would wish it.


CLEOPATRA

There's gold for thee.
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill:
I will employ thee back again; I find thee
Most fit for business: go make thee ready;
Our letters are prepared.
Exit Messenger


CHARMIAN

A proper man.


CLEOPATRA

Indeed, he is so: I repent me much
That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,
This creature's no such thing.


CHARMIAN

Nothing, madam.


CLEOPATRA

The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.


CHARMIAN

Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,
And serving you so long!


CLEOPATRA

I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian:
But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me
Where I will write. All may be well enough.


CHARMIAN

I warrant you, madam.
Exeunt
