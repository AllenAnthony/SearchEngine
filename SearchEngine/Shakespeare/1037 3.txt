SCENE II. A forest near Rome. Horns and cry of hounds heard.


Enter TITUS ANDRONICUS, with Hunters,  & c., MARCUS, LUCIUS, QUINTUS, and MARTIUS


TITUS ANDRONICUS

The hunt is up, the morn is bright and grey,
The fields are fragrant and the woods are green:
Uncouple here and let us make a bay
And wake the emperor and his lovely bride
And rouse the prince and ring a hunter's peal,
That all the court may echo with the noise.
Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours,
To attend the emperor's person carefully:
I have been troubled in my sleep this night,
But dawning day new comfort hath inspired.
A cry of hounds and horns, winded in a peal. Enter  SATURNINUS, TAMORA, BASSIANUS, LAVINIA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON, and Attendants
Many good morrows to your majesty;
Madam, to you as many and as good:
I promised your grace a hunter's peal.


SATURNINUS

And you have rung it lustily, my lord;
Somewhat too early for new-married ladies.


BASSIANUS

Lavinia, how say you?


LAVINIA

I say, no;
I have been broad awake two hours and more.


SATURNINUS

Come on, then; horse and chariots let us have,
And to our sport.
To TAMORA
Madam, now shall ye see
Our Roman hunting.


MARCUS ANDRONICUS

                  I have dogs, my lord,
Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase,
And climb the highest promontory top.


TITUS ANDRONICUS

And I have horse will follow where the game
Makes way, and run like swallows o'er the plain.


DEMETRIUS

Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound,
But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground.
Exeunt
