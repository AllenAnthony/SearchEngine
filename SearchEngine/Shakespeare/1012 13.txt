SCENE I. Padua. Before LUCENTIO'S house.


GREMIO discovered. Enter behind BIONDELLO, LUCENTIO, and BIANCA


BIONDELLO

Softly and swiftly, sir; for the priest is ready.


LUCENTIO

I fly, Biondello: but they may chance to need thee
at home; therefore leave us.


BIONDELLO

Nay, faith, I'll see the church o' your back; and
then come back to my master's as soon as I can.
Exeunt LUCENTIO, BIANCA, and BIONDELLO


GREMIO

I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, VINCENTIO, GRUMIO, with Attendants


PETRUCHIO

Sir, here's the door, this is Lucentio's house:
My father's bears more toward the market-place;
Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.


VINCENTIO

You shall not choose but drink before you go:
I think I shall command your welcome here,
And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward.
Knocks


GREMIO

They're busy within; you were best knock louder.
Pedant looks out of the window


Pedant

What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?


VINCENTIO

Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?


Pedant

He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.


VINCENTIO

What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to
make merry withal?


Pedant

Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall
need none, so long as I live.


PETRUCHIO

Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua.
Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances,
I pray you, tell Signior Lucentio that his father is
come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him.


Pedant

Thou liest: his father is come from Padua and here
looking out at the window.


VINCENTIO

Art thou his father?


Pedant

Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.


PETRUCHIO

[To VINCENTIO]  Why, how now, gentleman! why, this
is flat knavery, to take upon you another man's name.


Pedant

Lay hands on the villain: I believe a' means to
cozen somebody in this city under my countenance.
Re-enter BIONDELLO


BIONDELLO

I have seen them in the church together: God send
'em good shipping! But who is here? mine old
master Vincentio! now we are undone and brought to nothing.


VINCENTIO

[Seeing BIONDELLO]
Come hither, crack-hemp.


BIONDELLO

Hope I may choose, sir.


VINCENTIO

Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?


BIONDELLO

Forgot you! no, sir: I could not forget you, for I
never saw you before in all my life.


VINCENTIO

What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see
thy master's father, Vincentio?


BIONDELLO

What, my old worshipful old master? yes, marry, sir:
see where he looks out of the window.


VINCENTIO

Is't so, indeed.
Beats BIONDELLO


BIONDELLO

Help, help, help! here's a madman will murder me.
Exit


Pedant

Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!
Exit from above


PETRUCHIO

Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of
this controversy.
They retire
Re-enter Pedant below; TRANIO, BAPTISTA, and Servants


TRANIO

Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?


VINCENTIO

What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal
gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvet
hose! a scarlet cloak! and a copatain hat! O, I
am undone! I am undone! while I play the good
husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at
the university.


TRANIO

How now! what's the matter?


BAPTISTA

What, is the man lunatic?


TRANIO

Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your
habit, but your words show you a madman. Why, sir,
what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I
thank my good father, I am able to maintain it.


VINCENTIO

Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.


BAPTISTA

You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray, what do
you think is his name?


VINCENTIO

His name! as if I knew not his name: I have brought
him up ever since he was three years old, and his
name is Tranio.


Pedant

Away, away, mad ass! his name is Lucentio and he is
mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.


VINCENTIO

Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold
on him, I charge you, in the duke's name. O, my
son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio?


TRANIO

Call forth an officer.
Enter one with an Officer
Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista,
I charge you see that he be forthcoming.


VINCENTIO

Carry me to the gaol!


GREMIO

Stay, officer: he shall not go to prison.


BAPTISTA

Talk not, Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison.


GREMIO

Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be
cony-catched in this business: I dare swear this
is the right Vincentio.


Pedant

Swear, if thou darest.


GREMIO

Nay, I dare not swear it.


TRANIO

Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.


GREMIO

Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.


BAPTISTA

Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!


VINCENTIO

Thus strangers may be hailed and abused: O
monstrous villain!
Re-enter BIONDELLO, with LUCENTIO and BIANCA


BIONDELLO

O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him,
forswear him, or else we are all undone.


LUCENTIO

[Kneeling]  Pardon, sweet father.


VINCENTIO

Lives my sweet son?
Exeunt BIONDELLO, TRANIO, and Pedant, as fast as may be


BIANCA

Pardon, dear father.


BAPTISTA

How hast thou offended?
Where is Lucentio?


LUCENTIO

                  Here's Lucentio,
Right son to the right Vincentio;
That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,
While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne.


GREMIO

Here's packing, with a witness to deceive us all!


VINCENTIO

Where is that damned villain Tranio,
That faced and braved me in this matter so?


BAPTISTA

Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?


BIANCA

Cambio is changed into Lucentio.


LUCENTIO

Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
While he did bear my countenance in the town;
And happily I have arrived at the last
Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
What Tranio did, myself enforced him to;
Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.


VINCENTIO

I'll slit the villain's nose, that would have sent
me to the gaol.


BAPTISTA

But do you hear, sir? have you married my daughter
without asking my good will?


VINCENTIO

Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to: but
I will in, to be revenged for this villany.
Exit


BAPTISTA

And I, to sound the depth of this knavery.
Exit


LUCENTIO

Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.
Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA


GREMIO

My cake is dough; but I'll in among the rest,
Out of hope of all, but my share of the feast.
Exit


KATHARINA

Husband, let's follow, to see the end of this ado.


PETRUCHIO

First kiss me, Kate, and we will.


KATHARINA

What, in the midst of the street?


PETRUCHIO

What, art thou ashamed of me?


KATHARINA

No, sir, God forbid; but ashamed to kiss.


PETRUCHIO

Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.


KATHARINA

Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay.


PETRUCHIO

Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:
Better once than never, for never too late.
Exeunt
