SCENE III. London. A street.


Enter two Citizens meeting


First Citizen

Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?


Second Citizen

I promise you, I scarcely know myself:
Hear you the news abroad?


First Citizen

Ay, that the king is dead.


Second Citizen

Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the better:
I fear, I fear 'twill prove a troublous world.
Enter another Citizen


Third Citizen

Neighbours, God speed!


First Citizen

Give you good morrow, sir.


Third Citizen

Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?


Second Citizen

Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!


Third Citizen

Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.


First Citizen

No, no; by God's good grace his son shall reign.


Third Citizen

Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!


Second Citizen

In him there is a hope of government,
That in his nonage council under him,
And in his full and ripen'd years himself,
No doubt, shall then and till then govern well.


First Citizen

So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.


Third Citizen

Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot;
For then this land was famously enrich'd
With politic grave counsel; then the king
Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.


First Citizen

Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother.


Third Citizen

Better it were they all came by the father,
Or by the father there were none at all;
For emulation now, who shall be nearest,
Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.
O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!
And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud:
And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,
This sickly land might solace as before.


First Citizen

Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well.


Third Citizen

When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks;
When great leaves fall, the winter is at hand;
When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?
Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
All may be well; but, if God sort it so,
'Tis more than we deserve, or I expect.


Second Citizen

Truly, the souls of men are full of dread:
Ye cannot reason almost with a man
That looks not heavily and full of fear.


Third Citizen

Before the times of change, still is it so:
By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see
The waters swell before a boisterous storm.
But leave it all to God. whither away?


Second Citizen

Marry, we were sent for to the justices.


Third Citizen

And so was I: I'll bear you company.
Exeunt
