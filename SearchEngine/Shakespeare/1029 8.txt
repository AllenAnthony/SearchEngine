SCENE VIII. A field of battle.


Alarum as in battle. Enter, from opposite sides, MARCIUS and AUFIDIUS


MARCIUS

I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee
Worse than a promise-breaker.


AUFIDIUS

We hate alike:
Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.


MARCIUS

Let the first budger die the other's slave,
And the gods doom him after!


AUFIDIUS

If I fly, Marcius,
Holloa me like a hare.


MARCIUS

Within these three hours, Tullus,
Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,
And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood
Wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge
Wrench up thy power to the highest.


AUFIDIUS

Wert thou the Hector
That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,
Thou shouldst not scape me here.
They fight, and certain Volsces come to the aid of  AUFIDIUS. MARCIUS fights till they be driven in breathless
Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed me
In your condemned seconds.
Exeunt
