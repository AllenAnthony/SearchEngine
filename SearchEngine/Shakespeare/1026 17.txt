SCENE IV. The same.


Enter EXTON and Servant


EXTON

Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake,
'Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear?'
Was it not so?


Servant

                  These were his very words.


EXTON

'Have I no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice,
And urged it twice together, did he not?


Servant

He did.


EXTON

And speaking it, he wistly look'd on me,
And who should say, 'I would thou wert the man'
That would divorce this terror from my heart;'
Meaning the king at Pomfret. Come, let's go:
I am the king's friend, and will rid his foe.
Exeunt
