SCENE IV. London. The palace.


Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, young YORK, QUEEN ELIZABETH, and the DUCHESS OF YORK


ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton;
At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:
To-morrow, or next day, they will be here.


DUCHESS OF YORK

I long with all my heart to see the prince:
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.


QUEEN ELIZABETH

But I hear, no; they say my son of York
Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.


YORK

Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.


DUCHESS OF YORK

Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.


YORK

Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,
My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle
Gloucester,
'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'
And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.


DUCHESS OF YORK

Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
In him that did object the same to thee;
He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
So long a-growing and so leisurely,
That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.


ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.


DUCHESS OF YORK

I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.


YORK

Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,
I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,
To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.


DUCHESS OF YORK

How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.


YORK

Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.


DUCHESS OF YORK

I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?


YORK

Grandam, his nurse.


DUCHESS OF YORK

His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.


YORK

If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.


QUEEN ELIZABETH

A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd.


ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

Good madam, be not angry with the child.


QUEEN ELIZABETH

Pitchers have ears.
Enter a Messenger


ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

Here comes a messenger. What news?


Messenger

Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold.


QUEEN ELIZABETH

How fares the prince?


Messenger

Well, madam, and in health.


DUCHESS OF YORK

What is thy news then?


Messenger

Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret,
With them Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.


DUCHESS OF YORK

Who hath committed them?


Messenger

The mighty dukes
Gloucester and Buckingham.


QUEEN ELIZABETH

For what offence?


Messenger

The sum of all I can, I have disclosed;
Why or for what these nobles were committed
Is all unknown to me, my gracious lady.


QUEEN ELIZABETH

Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!
The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;
Insulting tyranny begins to jet
Upon the innocent and aweless throne:
Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!
I see, as in a map, the end of all.


DUCHESS OF YORK

Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
My husband lost his life to get the crown;
And often up and down my sons were toss'd,
For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:
And being seated, and domestic broils
Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.
Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,
Self against self: O, preposterous
And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;
Or let me die, to look on death no more!


QUEEN ELIZABETH

Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.
Madam, farewell.


DUCHESS OF YORK

                  I'll go along with you.


QUEEN ELIZABETH

You have no cause.


ARCHBISHOP OF YORK

                  My gracious lady, go;
And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
For my part, I'll resign unto your grace
The seal I keep: and so betide to me
As well I tender you and all of yours!
Come, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.
Exeunt
