SCENE VI. Dunsinane. Before the castle.


Drum and colours. Enter MALCOLM, SIWARD, MACDUFF, and their Army, with boughs


MALCOLM

Now near enough: your leafy screens throw down.
And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,
Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son,
Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we
Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,
According to our order.


SIWARD

Fare you well.
Do we but find the tyrant's power to-night,
Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.


MACDUFF

Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,
Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.
Exeunt
