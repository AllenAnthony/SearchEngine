SCENE IV. The same. A street.


Enter LEPIDUS, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA


LEPIDUS

Trouble yourselves no further: pray you, hasten
Your generals after.


AGRIPPA

Sir, Mark Antony
Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow.


LEPIDUS

Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,
Which will become you both, farewell.


MECAENAS

We shall,
As I conceive the journey, be at the Mount
Before you, Lepidus.


LEPIDUS

Your way is shorter;
My purposes do draw me much about:
You'll win two days upon me.


MECAENAS

AGRIPPA

Sir, good success!


LEPIDUS

Farewell.
Exeunt
