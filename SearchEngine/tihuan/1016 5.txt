SCENE II. Verona. JULIA'S house.


Enter PROTEUS and JULIA


PROTEUS

Have patience, gentle Julia.


JULIA

I must, where is no remedy.


PROTEUS

When possibly I can, I will return.


JULIA

If you turn not, you will return the sooner.
Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.
Giving a ring


PROTEUS

Why then, we'll make exchange; here, take you this.


JULIA

And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.


PROTEUS

Here is my hand for my true constancy;
And when that hour o'erslips me in the day
Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake,
The next ensuing hour some foul mischance
Torment me for my love's forgetfulness!
My father stays my coming; answer not;
The tide is now: nay, not thy tide of tears;
That tide will stay me longer than I should.
Julia, farewell!
Exit JULIA
What, gone without a word?
Ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak;
For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it.
Enter PANTHINO


PANTHINO

Sir Proteus, you are stay'd for.


PROTEUS

Go; I come, I come.
Alas! this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.
Exeunt
