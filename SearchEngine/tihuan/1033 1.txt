SCENE I. A desert place.


Thunder and lightning. Enter three Witches


First Witch

When shall we three meet again
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?


Second Witch

When the hurlyburly's done,
When the battle's lost and won.


Third Witch

That will be ere the set of sun.


First Witch

Where the place?


Second Witch

                  Upon the heath.


Third Witch

There to meet with Macbeth.


First Witch

I come, Graymalkin!


Second Witch

Paddock calls.


Third Witch

Anon.


ALL

Fair is foul, and foul is fair:
Hover through the fog and filthy air.
Exeunt
