SCENE III. The frontiers of Mantua. The forest.


Enter Outlaws with SILVIA


First Outlaw

Come, come,
Be patient; we must bring you to our captain.


SILVIA

A thousand more mischances than this one
Have learn'd me how to brook this patiently.


Second Outlaw

Come, bring her away.


First Outlaw

Where is the gentleman that was with her?


Third Outlaw

Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,
But Moyses and Valerius follow him.
Go thou with her to the west end of the wood;
There is our captain: we'll follow him that's fled;
The thicket is beset; he cannot 'scape.


First Outlaw

Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave:
Fear not; he bears an honourable mind,
And will not use a woman lawlessly.


SILVIA

O Valentine, this I endure for thee!
Exeunt
