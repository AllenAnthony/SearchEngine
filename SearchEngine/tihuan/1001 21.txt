SCENE I. Marseilles. A street.


Enter HELENA, Widow, and DIANA, with two Attendants


HELENA

But this exceeding posting day and night
Must wear your spirits low; we cannot help it:
But since you have made the days and nights as one,
To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,
Be bold you do so grow in my requital
As nothing can unroot you. In happy time;
Enter a Gentleman
This man may help me to his majesty's ear,
If he would spend his power. God save you, sir.


Gentleman

And you.


HELENA

Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.


Gentleman

I have been sometimes there.


HELENA

I do presume, sir, that you are not fallen
From the report that goes upon your goodness;
An therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions,
Which lay nice manners by, I put you to
The use of your own virtues, for the which
I shall continue thankful.


Gentleman

What's your will?


HELENA

That it will please you
To give this poor petition to the king,
And aid me with that store of power you have
To come into his presence.


Gentleman

The king's not here.


HELENA

Not here, sir!


Gentleman

Not, indeed:
He hence removed last night and with more haste
Than is his use.


Widow

                  Lord, how we lose our pains!


HELENA

ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL yet,
Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.
I do beseech you, whither is he gone?


Gentleman

Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon;
Whither I am going.


HELENA

I do beseech you, sir,
Since you are like to see the king before me,
Commend the paper to his gracious hand,
Which I presume shall render you no blame
But rather make you thank your pains for it.
I will come after you with what good speed
Our means will make us means.


Gentleman

This I'll do for you.


HELENA

And you shall find yourself to be well thank'd,
Whate'er falls more. We must to horse again.
Go, go, provide.
Exeunt
