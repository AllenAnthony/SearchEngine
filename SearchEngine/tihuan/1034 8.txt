SCENE II. A room in the castle.


Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Gentlemen


OTHELLO

These letters give, Iago, to the pilot;
And by him do my duties to the senate:
That done, I will be walking on the works;
Repair there to me.


IAGO

Well, my good lord, I'll do't.


OTHELLO

This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see't?


Gentleman

We'll wait upon your lordship.
Exeunt
