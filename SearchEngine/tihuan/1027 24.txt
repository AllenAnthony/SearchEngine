SCENE IV. Another part of the field.


Alarum: excursions. Enter NORFOLK and forces fighting; to him CATESBY


CATESBY

Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
The king enacts more wonders than a man,
Daring an opposite to every danger:
His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
Alarums. Enter KING RICHARD III


KING RICHARD III

A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!


CATESBY

Withdraw, my lord; I'll help you to a horse.


KING RICHARD III

Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,
And I will stand the hazard of the die:
I think there be six Richmonds in the field;
Five have I slain to-day instead of him.
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!
Exeunt
