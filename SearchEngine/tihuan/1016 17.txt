SCENE I. Milan. An abbey.


Enter EGLAMOUR


EGLAMOUR

The sun begins to gild the western sky;
And now it is about the very hour
That Silvia, at Friar Patrick's cell, should meet me.
She will not fail, for lovers break not hours,
Unless it be to come before their time;
So much they spur their expedition.
See where she comes.
Enter SILVIA
Lady, a happy evening!


SILVIA

Amen, amen! Go on, good Eglamour,
Out at the postern by the abbey-wall:
I fear I am attended by some spies.


EGLAMOUR

Fear not: the forest is not three leagues off;
If we recover that, we are sure enough.
Exeunt
