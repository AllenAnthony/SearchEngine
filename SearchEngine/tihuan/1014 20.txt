Troilus, thou coward Troilus, show thy head!
Enter DIOMEDES


DIOMEDES

Troilus, I say! where's Troilus?


AJAX

What wouldst thou?


DIOMEDES

I would correct him.


AJAX

Were I the general, thou shouldst have my office
Ere that correction. Troilus, I say! what, Troilus!
Enter TROILUS


TROILUS

O traitor Diomed! turn thy false face, thou traitor,
And pay thy life thou owest me for my horse!


DIOMEDES

Ha, art thou there?


AJAX

I'll fight with him alone: stand, Diomed.


DIOMEDES

He is my prize; I will not look upon.


TROILUS

Come, both you cogging Greeks; have at you both!
Exeunt, fighting
Enter HECTOR


HECTOR

Yea, Troilus? O, well fought, my youngest brother!
Enter ACHILLES


ACHILLES

Now do I see thee, ha! have at thee, Hector!


HECTOR

Pause, if thou wilt.


ACHILLES

I do disdain thy courtesy, proud Trojan:
Be happy that my arms are out of use:
My rest and negligence befriends thee now,
But thou anon shalt hear of me again;
Till when, go seek thy fortune.
Exit


HECTOR

Fare thee well:
I would have been much more a fresher man,
Had I expected thee. How now, my brother!
Re-enter TROILUS


TROILUS

Ajax hath ta'en AEneas: shall it be?
No, by the flame of yonder glorious heaven,
He shall not carry him: I'll be ta'en too,
Or bring him off: fate, hear me what I say!
I reck not though I end my life to-day.
Exit
Enter one in sumptuous armour


HECTOR

Stand, stand, thou Greek; thou art a goodly mark:
No? wilt thou not? I like thy armour well;
I'll frush it and unlock the rivets all,
But I'll be master of it: wilt thou not,
beast, abide?
Why, then fly on, I'll hunt thee for thy hide.
Exeunt
