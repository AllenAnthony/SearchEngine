SCENE V. Alexandria. MARK ANTONY's camp.


Trumpets sound. Enter MARK ANTONY and EROS; a Soldier meeting them


Soldier

The gods make this a happy day to Antony!


MARK ANTONY

Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd
To make me fight at land!


Soldier

Hadst thou done so,
The kings that have revolted, and the soldier
That has this morning left thee, would have still
Follow'd thy heels.


MARK ANTONY

Who's gone this morning?


Soldier

Who!
One ever near thee: call for Enobarbus,
He shall not hear thee; or from Caesar's camp
Say 'I am none of thine.'


MARK ANTONY

What say'st thou?


Soldier

Sir,
He is with Caesar.


EROS

                  Sir, his chests and treasure
He has not with him.


MARK ANTONY

Is he gone?


Soldier

Most certain.


MARK ANTONY

Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;
Detain no jot, I charge thee: write to him--
I will subscribe--gentle adieus and greetings;
Say that I wish he never find more cause
To change a master. O, my fortunes have
Corrupted honest men! Dispatch.--Enobarbus!
Exeunt
