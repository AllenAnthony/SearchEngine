SCENE IV. Country near Birnam wood.


Drum and colours. Enter MALCOLM, SIWARD and YOUNG  SIWARD, MACDUFF, MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS, LENNOX, ROSS, and Soldiers, marching


MALCOLM

Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand
That chambers will be safe.


MENTEITH

We doubt it nothing.


SIWARD

What wood is this before us?


MENTEITH

The wood of Birnam.


MALCOLM

Let every soldier hew him down a bough
And bear't before him: thereby shall we shadow
The numbers of our host and make discovery
Err in report of us.


Soldiers

It shall be done.


SIWARD

We learn no other but the confident tyrant
Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure
Our setting down before 't.


MALCOLM

'Tis his main hope:
For where there is advantage to be given,
Both more and less have given him the revolt,
And none serve with him but constrained things
Whose hearts are absent too.


MACDUFF

Let our just censures
Attend the true event, and put we on
Industrious soldiership.


SIWARD

The time approaches
That will with due decision make us know
What we shall say we have and what we owe.
Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,
But certain issue strokes must arbitrate:
Towards which advance the war.
Exeunt, marching
