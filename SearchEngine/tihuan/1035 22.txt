SCENE IV. Hall in Capulet's house.


Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse


LADY CAPULET

Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.


Nurse

They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
Enter CAPULET


CAPULET

Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
Spare not for the cost.


Nurse

Go, you cot-quean, go,
Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
For this night's watching.


CAPULET

No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.


LADY CAPULET

Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
But I will watch you from such watching now.
Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse


CAPULET

A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
Enter three or four Servingmen, with spits, logs, and baskets
Now, fellow,
What's there?


First Servant

Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.


CAPULET

Make haste, make haste.
Exit First Servant
Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.


Second Servant

I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
And never trouble Peter for the matter.
Exit


CAPULET

Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
The county will be here with music straight,
For so he said he would: I hear him near.
Music within
Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
Re-enter Nurse
Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
Make haste, I say.
Exeunt
