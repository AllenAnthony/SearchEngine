SCENE II. Before the walls of Athens.


Enter two Senators and a Messenger


First Senator

Thou hast painfully discover'd: are his files
As full as thy report?


Messenger

have spoke the least:
Besides, his expedition promises
Present approach.


Second Senator

We stand much hazard, if they bring not Timon.


Messenger

I met a courier, one mine ancient friend;
Whom, though in general part we were opposed,
Yet our old love made a particular force,
And made us speak like friends: this man was riding
From Alcibiades to Timon's cave,
With letters of entreaty, which imported
His fellowship i' the cause against your city,
In part for his sake moved.


First Senator

Here come our brothers.
Enter the Senators from TIMON


Third Senator

No talk of Timon, nothing of him expect.
The enemies' drum is heard, and fearful scouring
Doth choke the air with dust: in, and prepare:
Ours is the fall, I fear; our foes the snare.
Exeunt
