Enter ISABELLA and MARIANA


ISABELLA

To speak so indirectly I am loath:
I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,

ISABELLA

Enter FRIAR PETER

Where you may have such vantage on the duke,

The generous and gravest citizens
Have hent the gates, and very near upon
The duke is entering: therefore, hence, away!
Exeunt
